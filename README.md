This is my attempt to support vertical texts in FabricJS.
The build is pretty old, from Fabric version 4.
This component only support full sized charaters,
half sized will display in full sized bounding box

What works:
- Display Chinese/Japanese characters vertically
- Cursor/Select/Edit/Copy are working
- Styling

What does not works:
- Centered vertically
```

```
There is a interactive example in *main.js*
To start the example:
 $ npm run dev 
```
