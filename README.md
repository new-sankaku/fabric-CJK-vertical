I made some corrections to the prototype.
- Added the ability to align to the top, center, and bottom.

Currently, the following issues remain.
- Text2VerticalText doesn't work properly.
- Using "Line Height" multiple times causes a distorted display.
- "Character Spacing" has not been implemented at all.
- The font's Y and X axes do not scale when the top, bottom, left, or right corners of the box are grabbed.
- The font size does not scale when the top right, bottom right, bottom left, or top left corners of the box are grabbed.
- Gradients don't work.
